Sockets implementation:

Server.c
  Server.c socket is used to collect logs on clients. Logs are stored in server_log.txt.
  It opens a socket connection and waits for clients to connect.
  After the client is connected it puts each connection into a separate thread with its own handler and collects logs about client connection

Client.c
  Connects to a server and keeps the connection open until it is terminated.


server.c compilation: gcc -rthreads -o server_run server.c
client.c compilation: gcc -o client_run client.c
